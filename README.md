# 18th Birthday Site ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to the coolest digital invite for my 18th birthday! This isn't just any invitation; it's a mini-adventure, where you can dive into puzzles, crack some ciphers, and get all the deets for the party.

## What's the Deal?

So, here's the scoop: I whipped up this site in a single hour. Yep, you read that right â€“ 60 minutes flat. It's a showcase of what you can do with some HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a ticking clock. The site's got all the party info, but with a twist â€“ some details are tucked away behind puzzles using different cipher methods. Why? Because why not make things a bit more interesting!

### Features

- **Party Intel:** All the info you need, presented in a not-so-standard way.
- **RSVP Now:** An interactive form thatâ€™s also your ticket in.
- **Responsive AF:** Looks great on devices of all sizes.
- **GitHub Pages Magic:** Because the best hosting is free hosting.
- **Cipher Puzzles:** A few brain teasers to keep things spicy.
